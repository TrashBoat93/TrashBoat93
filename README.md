- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TrashBoat93
- Hi, my name is TrashBoat but people also call me Trash or Boat!
- Although I am new to game development it has always been a dream of mine to create something that I can be proud of!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity and C# but I am interested in any type of game.
- My goal is to one day work in the gaming industry and earn a living doing the thing I love most.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? You'll need long arms because I live in rural Australia lolololol.
- In all seriousness, reach out to me on Discord @trashboat0680
